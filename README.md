## Projects Abstract 

 **BOTZUP**

The success of a business website is defined by its ability to engage potential customers. And the best tool for customer engagement is an Al chatbot which can provide quick access to all the information a customer seeks. Unfortunately not every business could afford to deploy an Al chatbot on their website. The infrastructure cost and set up the process for deploying chatbot has put a blockade in front for most of e-commerce, promotional or organization websites. Accubits technologies in partnership with HongKong based solutions company - Customindz have built a platform which people can use to easily enable Al chatbot on their website.
 
Botzup is a web-based platform which can be used to integrate Al chatbot functionality to websites. As a user, one can use the Botzup dashboard to easily integrate the chatbot to their website and to easily configure different chat scenarios. Being built on top of Accubits Al chatbot engine, Botzup presents a natural chat experience to the potential customer by providing several services right from the chat interface.

 **MONGER**

The eCommerce platform provides a unique opportunity for its customers to pay back the education loan debts with the credits earned with each purchase they made through the platform. The platform lists hundreds of products from different vendors. Vendors upload the product images in bulk and Mongerhas to assign many employees to work for weeks to classify the images based on products. This process was very much time consuming and costly. They wanted a system which would automatically bin/classify the same images together.

We built an image classification tool based on machine learning algorithms to compare two product images and to find the degree of similarity between the two. Key points were extracted from the images and then matched to calculate the degree of similarity. Similarity, the product names are compared to calculate their differences and thus a final score was assigned. The solution was able to classify thousands of product images with a high degree of accuracy. This has reduced the time required for product image classification from weeks to around an hour. Eventually, the manpower required for the tedious job was cut short from many to one and the platform was able to updates the products much faster.

**NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION SYSTEM**

Some of the car dealerships across the US faced a problem with their customer satisfaction. Their customers had to wait a long time even to start the process of servicing their cars. In spite of affecting customer satisfaction, this also resulted in chaos in the customer reception process of the dealership.
Number plate recognition system helps in identifying the customer right when he reaches the entrance gate. State of the art pattern recognition technology that we have developed and used in number plate recognition. This technology can detect the license plate even from long distance and look up the database to collect information regarding who drove it. Automatically opening service slot to provide the best reception to customer.

This Sales assistant in MOAI can organise all the contacts and leads, do research through the leads to figure out the buying power and ranks them. The platform also manages the follow-ups to decrease the bounce rate and in turn grows the business network. Deep Neural Network is used in MOAI helps in lead ranking based on the past sales data of the business. It used TensorFlow for building and training the neural network. Python as a language, it used Scikit Learn to do the data classification, regression and clustering.

**SALESTRON**

One of the main issues that exist in any retail industry is the information gap existing between employees occupying different sales positions, like a salesperson, sales manager & general manager. Non-moving products should be given special care and strategy to sell it more or to make it more visible to customers. But the information gap is a hindrance to this. Currently, stores are not able to create relevant personalised offers and deals in real-time.

Lack of technology to track customer interests while he is inside the store is a reason why stores are missing selling opportunities in a large scale. Salestron has helped many retail stores across the world to solve these problems and to make a huge increase in their in-store sales. Salestron helps in real-time updation of stocks and their profit margins, as a result of this everyone using salestron can immediately know about margins of a commodity without consulting a higher authority personal.

Salestronâ€™s map enables the salesperson and store manager to get a real-time heat map of users around different products in a shop, and thereby assign sale persons to attend as specific product sections as per the user's need. By understanding customer buying patterns and real-time customer interests, the system can suggest products to the user which are less moving and the customer might buy. This will increase the sales of those non-moving products without spending a lot on the advertisement.

**FORENSICS SOFTWARE**

Searching and analyzing information that is seized from a suspect's device is one of the most important parts in forensics. Most of the information available in a suspectâ€™s device would be in their native language, for a country like India which has 22 constitutionally recognized languages, it would be so difficult to maintain software which helps to explore this information without introducing more complexity to the procedure and without costing much. The proposed system implements language recognition, indexing, searching & opinion extraction for 14 Indian Languages.
